    "\n",
    "Our project aims to determine whether or not there is racial bias in medical LLM (Med-Palm-2 or OpenBioLLM-70B) recommendations for treatment. We will present the LLM with a diverse set of patients that have similar conditions/chief complaints and get a recommendation from the LLM. Then we'll check the statistical distance (Cohen's D) between two types of recommendations (intervention, non-intervention) for each race and determine if the LLM is giving different styles of answers for different races of people, which we hope it does not."
